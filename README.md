# Snake
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food appearing on the screen. The snake grows in size with each food consumed, and the objective is to avoid hitting the boundaries of the game area.

## Features:

Grid-Based Movement: The snake moves on a grid, ensuring consistent and precise gameplay.

Boundary Collision: The game ends only if the snake hits the boundaries, making it more challenging.

Smooth Gameplay: Optimized for high refresh rates, making the snake's movement fluid, especially on screens with higher refresh rates like 120Hz.

Custom Controls: Control the snake using the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys for up, left, down, and right movements respectively.

Scalable Difficulty: The speed of the snake can be adjusted, allowing players to set the difficulty level to their preference.

## Gameplay:

The snake starts moving as soon as the game begins.

As the snake consumes food, it grows longer.

The game continues until the snake hits the boundary of the game area.

## How to Play:

Use 'W' to move up, 'A' to move left, 'S' to move down, and 'D' to move right.

Avoid hitting the game boundaries to keep playing and see how long you can grow the snake!

This Snake game is a fun and nostalgic way to challenge yourself and improve your hand-eye coordination.
